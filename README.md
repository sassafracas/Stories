# Storybook
Website for users to display collections of photos built using **Ruby on Rails** and **React**. UI built with **Semantic UI React**. Other libraries used were: **React Router**, and **React Responsive Carousel**.

## Functionality
Users can sign up, upload, and share small photo albums. There are three pages, the first being the *My Stories* page where a user can see all of their photo albums that they've uploaded. The second page is the *Explore* page where users can see all the publically shared photo albums of other users. The third page is the *Upload* page where a user can upload their photos and see previews of them.
